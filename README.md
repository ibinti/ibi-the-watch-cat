Autonomous Security Watch Robot

I'm excited to share my Autonomous Security Watch Robot project at the Vancouver Robotics Club meetup (https://www.meetup.com/vancouverroboticsclub) on July 20, 2025. This self-explanatory project focuses on developing a robot capable of independent security surveillance.

It's currently in the idea stage, and I'm exploring various aspects of its design and functionality.

I'm thinking through things like:

    Key features: What specific tasks will it perform?

    Navigation: How will it move independently?

    Sensors: What technologies will it use to perceive its environment?

I'm looking forward to refining these ideas as the project progresses!
