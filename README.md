Autonomous Safety Monitor Watch AI Robot

I'm excited to share my Autonomous Safety Monitor Watch AI Robot project. This self-explanatory project focuses on developing a mobile AI robot capable of independent safety surveillance.

It's currently in the idea stage, and I'm exploring various aspects of its design and functionality.

I'm thinking through things like:

    Key features: What specific tasks will it perform?

    Navigation: How will it move independently?

    Sensors: What technologies will it use to perceive its environment?

chtgpt prompt: create an image of watch cat on duty. better to have a on duty badge or strap somewhere on body.

here is an ideal image of ibi created

I'm looking forward to refining these ideas as the project progresses!
