Autonomous Safety Monitor Watch AI Robot

I'm excited to share my Autonomous Safety Monitor Watch AI Robot project. This self-explanatory project focuses on developing a mobile AI robot capable of independent safety surveillance.

It's currently in the idea stage, and I'm exploring various aspects of its design and functionality.

At the moment, there exists a significant gap between the ideal ibi vs the real ibi. Current project goal is to minimize the existing gap.

  <img src="ibi-the-watch-cat-reality.png" alt="After state" width="350" style="display: inline-block; margin: 0 15px;">
</div>

I'm thinking through things like:

    Key features: What specific tasks will it perform?

    Navigation: How will it move independently?

    Sensors: What technologies will it use to perceive its environment?



I'm looking forward to refining these ideas as the project progresses!
