Autonomous Safety Monitor Watch AI Robot

I'm excited to share my Autonomous Safety Monitor Watch AI Robot project. This self-explanatory project focuses on developing a mobile AI robot capable of independent safety surveillance.

It's currently in the idea stage, and I'm exploring various aspects of its design and functionality.

I'm thinking through things like:

    Key features: What specific tasks will it perform?

    Navigation: How will it move independently?

    Sensors: What technologies will it use to perceive its environment?

This is an ideal image of ibi created with chtgpt prompt: create an image of watch cat on duty. better to have a on duty badge or strap somewhere on body.

This is the reality at the moment.

<div align="center">
  <img src="ibi-the-watch-cat-ideal.png" alt="Before state" width="350" style="display: inline-block; margin: 0 15px;">
  <img src="ibi-the-watch-cat-ideal.png" alt="After state" width="350" style="display: inline-block; margin: 0 15px;">
</div>

<div align="center">
  <div style="display: inline-block; text-align: center; margin: 0 10px;">
    <h3>Ideal</h3>

<table style="width:100%; border:none;">
  <tr>
    <td style="width:50%; text-align:center; vertical-align:top; border:none; padding:10px;">
      <h3>Ideal</h3>
      <img src="ibi-the-watch-cat-ideal.png" alt="The state of the system before changes were applied." width="350">
    </td>
    <td style="width:50%; text-align:center; vertical-align:top; border:none; padding:10px;">
      <h3>Reality</h3>
      <img src="ibi-the-watch-cat-ideal.png" alt="The state of the system after changes were applied, showing improvements." width="350">
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

I'm looking forward to refining these ideas as the project progresses!
