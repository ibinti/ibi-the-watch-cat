this is `ibi the watch cat`

```python
print("ibi ibi on the watch - what do you see?")
"""
there are a few good watch cats, some are bad, and the rest are ugly 
but there are always random angry cats
"""

print("ibi ibi on the watch - why so?")
"""
it is the nature of the universe as far as i know.
the overall distribution is well defined even though 
it is not well defined which cat will fall under.
