AI Overview

.NET 9 MAUI Blazor Hybrid Web refers to a development approach that combines the capabilities of .NET Multi-platform App UI (.NET MAUI) and Blazor to create applications that can run both as native desktop/mobile apps and as web applications, sharing a significant portion of their UI code.
Key aspects of .NET 9 MAUI Blazor Hybrid Web:

    Blazor Hybrid Apps:
    These are .NET MAUI applications that host a Blazor web app within an embedded BlazorWebView control. This allows Razor components to run natively within the .NET process while rendering web UI in a web view.
    Code Reusability:
    The core advantage is the ability to reuse Blazor UI components (Razor components) across different platforms:
        Native Platforms: Through .NET MAUI, the Blazor Hybrid app can target Android, iOS, macOS, and Windows.
        Web Platform: The same Blazor components can be used to build a standard Blazor Web App that runs in a web browser. 
    Shared Razor Class Library (RCL):
    A common pattern for this approach is to create a shared Razor Class Library that contains the UI components. Both the .NET MAUI Blazor Hybrid app and the Blazor Web App can then reference and utilize these shared components.
    Solution Template:
    .NET 9 introduces a specific solution template in Visual Studio to simplify the creation of such applications. This template sets up a solution containing both a .NET MAUI Blazor Hybrid project and a Blazor Web App project, along with a shared Razor Class Library.
    Dependency Injection:
    The architecture supports using dependency injection to provide different service implementations depending on whether the application is running in the native Blazor Hybrid context or the web context, allowing for platform-specific functionalities.

This approach offers developers a way to leverage their web development skills with Blazor to build cross-platform native applications and web applications from a single codebase, maximizing code reuse and efficiency.
